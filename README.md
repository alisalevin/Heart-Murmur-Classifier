# Heart-Murmur-Classifier

An exploration of machine learning applications for heart murmur detection and classifiacton. 

Training KNN and SVM models in Python on different heart sound feature sets and analyzing cross-validated accuracies and confusion matrices to demonstrate classification improvement due to our unique, non-traditional heart sound and heart murmur features.
